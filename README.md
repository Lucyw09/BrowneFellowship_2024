# BrowneFellowship_2024

Welcome to my GitHub Repository for the Browne Leadership Fellowship. 

Hello, I'm Lucy! I was accepted into the Browne Leadership Fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh - School of Social Work in November 2023. I was placed with Assemble, located in Garfield, PA. At Assemble, I worked as a teacher with the Summer Camp programming for grades 1-9. I lead and co-taught lessons, prepared supplies for guest expert lessons, and helped re-organize and clean the studio space as the space transitioned from the Afterschool and Saturday Crafternoon programming to Summer Camp and Queer Craft Night. 
At the end of the fellowship, each of the fellows had to organize a poster highlighting my experiences in our paired neighborhood. 

This is Repository contains all the data I used and code I wrote for my fall poster presentation and more! The code related to my poster presentation was solely for streamlining the data visualization.

The contents of this reposity go beyond the work I did for the Fellowship. Through my exploration during the Fellowship, I engaged with community data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). I am interested in continuing to explore Pittsburgh, particularly the Garfield neighborhood, through this data and giving it context to the best of my ability. 

This is an ongoing project, much of the analysis is not done yet! I am still working on reading journals to help give the data context, but as I continue to learn more about Garfield, there are infinitely more nuanced datapoints I want to look at. 

Thank you for being interested and following along!

Best,

Lucy Wang
